          </h4>
          <li>


              In 1957, Morton Heilig invented a large booth-like machine called the Sensorama, 
              which was intended to combine multiple technologies to give one to four people 
              the illusion of being in a fully 3D immersive world — complete with smell, stereo sound,
              vibrations, and even atmospheric effects like wind in the hair. A few years later, in 1960, 
              he honed a version of this idea into a patent for the world’s first head-mounted display, 
              promising stereoscopic 3D images, wide vision, and true stereo sound.
          </li>
          <h4>
            1968
          </h4>
          <li>
            The first actual VR head-mounted display (HMD) was created in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan 
            Sutherland. Sutherland was one of the most important figures in the history of computer graphics, 
            having developed the revolutionary “Sketchpad” software that paves the way for tools like Computer-Aided 
            Design (CAD).

            Sutherland’s HMD was a project he described as “the ultimate display.” It connected to a stereoscopic display 
            from a computer program depicting simple virtual wireframe shapes, which changed perspective as the user moved 
            his or her head.
          </li>
          <h4>
            1975
          </h4>
          <li>
            At around the same time that Ivan Sutherland was working on his “Sword of Damocles” project, a military engineer 
            named Thomas Furness was busy developing an ambitious flight simulator project which eventually grows into something 
            called the “Super Cockpit.”

            Furness continued working on the project through the 1980s, with the result being a training cockpit able to project 
            computer-generated 3D maps, infrared and radar imagery, as well as avionics data into a real-time 3D space. According to 
            Furness, the project costs into the “hundreds of millions.” Way ahead of its time, the Super Cockpit allows a trainee pilot to 
            control an aircraft using gestures, speech, and even eye movements.

              Aspen Movie Map was created by MIT. This program enabled users to virtually wander through Aspen city in Colorado, like 
              with Google Street View. There were three modes: summer, winter and polygons.

              It was created using photographs from a car driving through the city. There were no HMDs but it was the use of first-person
              interactivity and it suggested that VR could transport people to other places.

            1986
          </h4>
          <li>
              Furness developed a flight simulator between 1986-1989 known as the Super Cockpit. The training cockpit featured: computer-generated 
              3D maps, advanced infrared and radar imagery and the pilot could see and hear in real-time.

              The helmet's tracking system and sensors allowed the pilot to control the aircraft using gestures, speech and eye movements.

              Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy console which played 3D monochrome video games. It was the first portable console to display 3D graphics. 
              But it was a commercial failure due to: the lack of colour graphics, lack of software support and it wasn't comfortable to use. 
              One year later it was discontinued.Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy console which played 3D monochrome video games.

              Google introduced a stereoscopic 3D mode for Street View.

              Palmer Luckey, an 18 year old entrepreneur, created the first 
              prototype of the Oculus Rift headset. It featured a 90-degree field of vision, which had never been seen before, 
              and relied on a computer's processing power to deliver the images. This new development boosted and refreshed interest in VR.

          Sony may be developing a similar location tracking tech to HTC's VIVE for the PlayStation 4.

            Medical Training
            Virtual Reality has the ability to transport you inside the human body – to access & view areas that otherwise would be impossible to reach. 
            Currently, medical students learn on cadavers, which are difficult to get hold of and (obviously) do not react in the same way a live patient would. 
            In VR however, you can view minute detail of any part of the body in stunning 360° CGI reconstruction & create training scenarios which replicate common 
            surgical procedures.

            Robotic surgery is a recent innovation in which surgery is performed using a robotic device, e.g. robotic arm which is controlled by a human surgeon. 
            This means fewer risks of complications during surgery and a faster procedure. The robotic device is accurate, meaning smaller incisions, reduced blood 
            loss and faster recovery

            All pilots, from Air Force to commercial to private jet pilots, have been trained in flight simulators for close to a century. 
            But virtual reality is about to change the way students are taught at pilot training schools, in what is set to be more than just a 
            breakthrough for technology. A VR pilot training system has the potential to significantly lower flight training costs while decreasing 
            Air Force budgets. They can even be used to train mechanics.

            Advances in mixed reality let educational technology developers create more expansive and complex anatomical models.
            Originally, AR and VR lesson plans revolved around the virtual field trip. Teachers could transport students to otherwise 
            unreachable destinations, from the Colosseum at the height of the Roman Empire to the surface of the moon.
            
            For biology classes, students can use VR headsets to take a ride through their veins on the back of a red blood cell
            or witness the light display of millions of neurons firing together.
            
            Classrooms with the HTC Vive, for example, can take a detailed, 3D-rendered journey through a cell to learn how the body 
            fights off viruses.

            The National Museum of Natural History opened its first permanent VR exhibition in 2018. The installation deals with evolution, 
            as part of the wider scope of the museum.
            When they enter the “Cabinet of Virtual Reality” and don the VR headsets, visitors are fully immersed in a journey of discovery. 
            They can explore the links between species, viewing a variety of creatures up close and to scale.
