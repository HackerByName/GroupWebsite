	<h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

	<h2>A Brief History of AI</h2>

	<p>
The idea of artificial intelligence has been around for a long time, however, the implementation of it
had not harboured into existence until the official birth (1940s-1950s.) The earliest research into
‘thinking machines’ was inspired by research into neurology which showed that the brain had an
electrical network of neurons that were able to fire around the body to send information. Norbert
Wiener was an American mathematician who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) and used cybernetics to describe the control and stability in electrical networks. This study
mainly involved understanding the control and communication in the animal and machine.
Information theory (proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948) was used in conjunction with cybernetics
to describe digital signals involved in data compression and channel coding. Another researcher that
developed the birth of artificial intelligence was Alan Turing who was known as the father of
computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing’s theory explained how any form of computation
could be described digitally. These three researchers developed the initial relationship that was used
to comprehend the possibility of constructing an electronic brain.</p>

	<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Two years after the Paris Climate accord had taken place; Microsoft announced that they were
introducing a $50 million project in order to bring artificial intelligence to protect the planet. This
five-year project would enable organisations worldwide to be provided with data to slow the rate of
global warming. Artificial intelligence can be programmed to collect the vast amount of data from
sensors around the world (from the sky and space) and use this data to help both humans and
computers understand our continuously changing planet by converting the data into information
and use the information to inform individuals how to manage our natural resources. For example,
the data collected by the AI could be 408.05, when converted into information can become 408.05
parts per millions of carbon in the air on a global scale from last month. AI would then use its trained
skills to inform us how much wood we are able to use for the rest of the month in order to keep
within the Paris Climate accord.

The use of artificial intelligence to tackle climate change has already shown some results in the
energy sector as companies such as Adger Energi (the third largest renewable energy group in
Norway) are utilising Microsoft’s cloud and AI to better capture, analyse and act on the information
gathered across its electrical grid. This allows Adger Energi to predict and prepare for fluctuating
energy needs in response to changes in demand. This is because electric vehicles increasingly tax
Norway's grid, therefore, AI and data have improved the performance of existing infrastructure
(power supplies) and have reduced the need for new, expensive projects such as building another
power station in order to meet energy demands.
By using AI in the environmental sector, a more effective and reliable grid has been created, allowing
the country to consume more renewable energy as it transitions into a more electricity-based and
greener future.</p>
