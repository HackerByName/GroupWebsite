	<h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

	<h2>A Brief History of AI</h2>

  <p>
The idea of artificial intelligence has been around for a long time, however, the implementation of it
had not harboured into existence until the official birth (1940s-1950s.) The earliest research into
‘thinking machines’ was inspired by research into neurology which showed that the brain had an
electrical network of neurons that were able to fire around the body to send information. Norbert
Wiener was an American mathematician who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) and used cybernetics to describe the control and stability in electrical networks. This study
mainly involved understanding the control and communication in the animal and machine.
Information theory (proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948) was used in conjunction with cybernetics
to describe digital signals involved in data compression and channel coding. Another researcher that
developed the birth of artificial intelligence was Alan Turing who was known as the father of
computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing’s theory explained how any form of computation
could be described digitally. These three researchers developed the initial relationship that was used
to comprehend the possibility of constructing an electronic brain.</p>


	<h2>Healthcare</h2>
  <image src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.ayasdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/13140221/healthcare-big-data.jpg" alt="medicine" height="150" align="center" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
	<p>A TEDx talk hosted by Suchi Saria talked about how artificial intelligence and machine learning can
create better medicine by solving the problem of detecting symptoms faster than current medical
treatment. This would allow doctors to prescribe the correct medicine at the right time in order to
cure the patient which would be a huge breakthrough for the cure of sepsis as it is an extremely
difficult condition for doctors to diagnose as it is often confused with other diseases, therefore it is
not treated correctly or on time. This is done through ‘TREWS’ which is an acronym for ‘Targeted
Real-time Early Warning Score’. TREWS is machine learning that goes through electronic medical
records and analyses the data (symptoms, signs) of past patients that have had sepsis compared to
those that do not. However, this would not be specific enough to diagnose sepsis alone. TREWS also
checks every context available before diagnosing the patient for having sepsis. For example,
creatinine is a waste molecule in the body filtered out by the kidney. If the body is septic, your
kidneys start to fail therefore decreases the ability to filter the creatinine out through your urine
which causes the creatinine levels in your body to rise. This could mean that the patient has sepsis,
but it could also suggest that the patient has a different disease such as chronic kidney disease as
the kidneys would also fail for this condition. What TREWS can do is determine whether the patient
has chronic kidney failure or sepsis by analysing every medical record in every context available and
see if the symptoms occur more often in sepsis patients or those without. TREWS is able to diagnose
12 to 24 hours faster than a doctor could diagnose the patients and if used in every country, it could
reduce the number of people affected by sepsis each year (it currently affects over 26 million people
worldwide each year) and will allow the 11 th leading cause of death to be prevented.</p>


	<h2>Environment</h2>
  <image src="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/assets/img/sliders/envstats/Newsletter.jpg" alt="environment" height="150" align="center" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
<p>Two years after the Paris Climate accord had taken place; Microsoft announced that they were
introducing a $50 million project in order to bring artificial intelligence to protect the planet. This
five-year project would enable organisations worldwide to be provided with data to slow the rate of
global warming. Artificial intelligence can be programmed to collect the vast amount of data from
sensors around the world (from the sky and space) and use this data to help both humans and
computers understand our continuously changing planet by converting the data into information
and use the information to inform individuals how to manage our natural resources. For example,
the data collected by the AI could be 408.05, when converted into information can become 408.05
parts per millions of carbon in the air on a global scale from last month. AI would then use its trained
skills to inform us how much wood we are able to use for the rest of the month in order to keep
within the Paris Climate accord.

<p>
The use of artificial intelligence to tackle climate change has already shown some results in the
energy sector as companies such as Adger Energi (the third largest renewable energy group in
Norway) are utilising Microsoft’s cloud and AI to better capture, analyse and act on the information
gathered across its electrical grid. This allows Adger Energi to predict and prepare for fluctuating
energy needs in response to changes in demand. This is because electric vehicles increasingly tax
Norway's grid, therefore, AI and data have improved the performance of existing infrastructure
(power supplies) and have reduced the need for new, expensive projects such as building another
power station in order to meet energy demands.
By using AI in the environmental sector, a more effective and reliable grid has been created, allowing
the country to consume more renewable energy as it transitions into a more electricity-based and
greener future.</p>

	<h2>Transportation</h2>

<p>The transportation industry is one of the most popular in the world, with 25.8 million cars used by
people in England alone (2015), it is estimated that this number will continue to increase by 600,000
each year. This will cause huge technology companies such as Google to invest in this market and
create a product that distinguishes from the normal, everyday vehicles. In 2009, Google started the
self-driving car project, aiming to use artificial intelligence in order to replace the average car in the
near future. 9 years later, Google has established its very own independent company called Waymo
doing exactly this. While still being a new concept for most people, Waymo has already created
minivans and last year Waymo gathered many groups of people from Arizona, the USA to come and
test the self-driving cars. By integrating sensors and software to drive, detect pedestrians, cyclists
and vehicles roadworks using 360-degree vision, Waymo used 4 million miles of on the road
experience worldwide to teach the self-driving cars how to safely navigate through everyday traffic.
A Velodyne 64 beam laser was attached to all of the self-driving cars to create a detailed 3D map of
the cars current surroundings, this was then converted to a map and integrated with high-resolution
maps of the world which created different types of data models that allow the car to drive itself. This
is done through machine learning, where the data from the 4 million miles of road was collected and
analysed to see how traffic flowed as well as detecting signals such as traffic lights and car indicators.
